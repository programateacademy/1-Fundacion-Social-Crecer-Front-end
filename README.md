# Fundacion Social Crecer Front-end

To understand the development and realization of the project it is necessary to know the problems raised and the operation of the organization, which is why, during the development of this document, the fundamental bases of it will be known for its correct development, traceability and future/potential scope. .
We started the first phase of the application that would be the solution to the problem of the growing social foundation.
Here we will show how the frontend part works.
We created the entire login interface, the view of the table of beneficiaries and officials that can only be seen by someone who is a super administrator.
